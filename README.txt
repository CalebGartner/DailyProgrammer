Dailyprogrammer is about challenging programmers of all skill level with weekly programming challenges. 3 challenges a week are posted at increasing difficulty. Solutions are peer reviewed and redditors can ask for the community for feedback and comments.

The typical posting of challenges occur on or near the following days.

Mon [Easy]
Wed [Intermediate]
Fri [Hard]

Challenges are developed from ideas posted on /r/DailyProgrammer_ideas and ideas from the moderator team.

Also note that the moderator team might not be able to post a challenge for an assigned day. This could be for many reasons. Although the moderator team strives to keep challenges posted as needed but if a challenge cannot or does not get posted, please consider looking or working on older challenges and continue to wait for the next challenge.
